## Project Description

We are developing an AI system that processes full 3D lung CT scans to automatically detect and analyze pulmonary nodules.  
The system applies advanced preprocessing, 3D nodule detection, and deep-learning–based segmentation to extract tumor regions.  
A malignancy classifier evaluates each nodule and assigns a risk score or Lung-RADS category.  
The model output includes visual overlays, quantitative measurements, and a patient-level risk summary.  
Our goal is to build a clinically meaningful diagnostic assistant that supports radiologists in early lung cancer detection.

## Project Overview

Our project focuses on developing an end-to-end AI-driven system to automatically detect lung nodules in 3D CT scans, segment them, and predict malignancy risk. This system leverages deep learning, 3D medical image processing, cloud infrastructure, and MLOps workflows to replicate core tasks in a radiologist’s diagnostic process. Over the semester, this document will expand to include the abstract, problem statement, motivation, technical background, methodology, evaluation plan, and final results.
